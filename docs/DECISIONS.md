# Lattice — Decision Log

Append-only. Each entry: decision, why, alternatives rejected. Revisit only with reason.

## D1 — Single Go binary, two roles (`hub` / `agent`)
**Why:** one artifact per (OS,arch) → trivial distribution → packageable. Go = static
binaries, no runtime deps, first-class cross-compilation.
**Rejected:** Node/Electron agent (heavy, runtime deps, per-OS pain); Rust (slower iteration
for this team); separate hub+agent codebases (2× release surface).

## D2 — Agents dial OUT to the hub (no inbound listener on leaves)
**Why:** zero inbound firewall/port-forward config on every device → works behind NAT/CGNAT/
mobile → packageable. Hub holds persistent WebSockets; commands flow over the existing socket.
**Rejected:** hub SSHes into agents (re-introduces every per-OS SSH quirk we're trying to kill,
needs inbound config on each leaf).

## D3 — Tailnet for transport + network auth; enrollment token for app identity
**Why:** WireGuard gives encryption + "only my devices can even reach the hub" for free. Token
enrollment binds an agent to a device. No passwords/API keys in the happy path.
**Rejected:** rolling our own TLS/PKI + auth (slow, error-prone, not the value-add).

## D4 — Embedded SQLite for hub state
**Why:** zero-config, single-file, ships inside the binary's footprint → packageable.
**Rejected:** Postgres/Redis (external services to install — anti-packageable).

## D5 — Phase 1 piggybacks on system Tailscale; tsnet embed deferred
**Why:** don't block the proof-of-concept on embedding the tailnet. Dylan's fleet already runs
Tailscale. Migrate to `tsnet` for the shipped product so users don't install Tailscale separately.
**Rejected:** building tsnet embedding first (premature; slows the proof).

## D6 — Build all binaries by cross-compiling from mini-ops
**Why:** no Go toolchain on leaves (esp. Windows/Termux). Go cross-compiles trivially. Mirrors
how the real product will ship prebuilt binaries.
**Rejected:** installing Go per machine (toolchain drift, Windows pain).

## D7 — Dashboard = React + TS + Vite + Tailwind, served by hub
**Why:** Dylan's house stack; dark-first; static bundle embeds cleanly into the hub; browser-
first means the phone and every OS get the UI with zero install.
**Rejected:** native UI per OS first (huge surface before proving value); TUI (not the vision).

## D8 — code-server for the workspace (phase 3), not Theia (yet)
**Why:** faster to embed/proxy; mature; delivers the file-explorer + editor + terminal + doc
view Dylan wants. Theia is the heavier "build a branded IDE" path — revisit if/when branding matters.

## D9 — Provisional name "Lattice"
**Why:** mesh imagery, reasonably clear of big collisions (`helm`=k8s, `fleet`=fleetdm).
**Status:** placeholder; finalize before any public/GitHub release.
